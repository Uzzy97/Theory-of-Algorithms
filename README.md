# Calculation of the MD5 digest of an input

### Problem Statement
<strong><em><p>We are instructed write a program in the C programming language that calculates the MD5 hash digest of an input. The algorithm is specified in the Request For Comments 1321 document supplied by the Internet Engineering Task Force. The only pre-requisite is that your program performs the algorithm â€” you are free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on. We are also suggested to allow the user to input some free text or a filename via the command line.</p></em></strong>
