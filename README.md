# Calculation of the MD5 digest of an input

### Problem Statement
<strong><em><p>We are instructed write a program in the C programming language that calculates the MD5 hash digest of an input. The algorithm is specified in the Request For Comments 1321 document supplied by the Internet Engineering Task Force. The only pre-requisite is that your program performs the algorithm â€” you are free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on. We are also suggested to allow the user to input some free text or a filename via the command line.</p></em></strong>

### What is a MD5 hashing algorithm?
The MD5 hashing algorithm is a one-way cryptographic feature that accepts an input message of any length and returns a fixed-length digest value to be used to authenticate the original message as the output. The MD5 hash function was originally intended to be used as a secure cryptographic hash algorithm for digital signature authentication. To verify data integrity and prevent unintended data manipulation, MD5 has been deprecated for uses other than as a non-cryptographic checksum. While originally developed as a cryptographic message authentication code algorithm for use on the internet, for use as a cryptographic checksum, MD5 hashing is no longer considered reliable because researchers have demonstrated techniques that can easily produce MD5 collisions on commercial off - the-shelf computers.

### How MD5 Works
The MD5 message digest hashing algorithm processes data in 512-bit blocks, broken down into 16 words composed of 32 bits each. The output from MD5 is a 128-bit message digest value.
