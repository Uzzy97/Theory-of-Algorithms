##### Problem Statment
<p> You must write a program in the C programming language that calculates
the MD5 hash digest of an input. The algorithm is specified in the Request
For Comments 1321 document supplied by the Internet Engineering Task
Force. The only pre-requisite is that your program performs the algorithm
â€” you are free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on.
I suggest you allow the user to input some free text or a filename via the
command line.</p>

##### Introduction
The repository contains two folders, SHA256-Algorithm and MD5. The repository also consists of a .gitignore file and a readme.md file which contains the research conducted while carrying out this project. Shortly, I will be going through everything in the repository in-depth. Finally, there is a folder called images , which I needed to upload sketches of my diagrams and understanding of the algorithm.

###### MD5 Folder
This folder consists of a file called MD5.c It is written in the C Programming language. Anyone will be able to understand of what is going through within the file as it is thoroughly commented of what each step does within the code. I understand for a junior software developer, it may be difficult to understand. Further within this documentation, the algorithm will be explained with the usage of diagrams.
